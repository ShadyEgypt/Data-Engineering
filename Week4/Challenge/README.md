This is the challenge of week 4

Objective
In this challenge, you will go through the steps of building an ETL data
pipeline for “Spotify” public API. You have to construct a python project
that extracts any desired artist’s songs data, transform or validate
them if required, and load the data into a PostgreSQL database table.
You have to parse the extracted data into a Pandas dataframe of only
two columns (song_name, album_name), and reflect that on the
database table accordingly
